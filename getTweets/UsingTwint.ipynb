      "867186812497690624 2017-05-23 21:13:42 EDT <elonmusk> Will keep the original Bond Lotus sub as-is. That design can't actually convert from car to sub. Have a new design in mind that does.\n",
      "867146773562654720 2017-05-23 18:34:36 EDT <elonmusk> True :)\n",
      "867146453868724224 2017-05-23 18:33:20 EDT <elonmusk> Feel exactly the same way as A.O. Scott. Particularly loved The Spy Who Loved Me https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/05/23/movies/roger-moore-was-the-best-bond-because-he-was-the-gen-x-bond.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=second-column-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news&_r=1&referer= https://t.co/7vsThOkyQ6 …\n",
      "866851007317155840 2017-05-22 22:59:20 EDT <elonmusk> All Model S and X cars will have an auto raise and lower function for the steering wheel in a few months.\n",
      "866798148303200256 2017-05-22 19:29:17 EDT <elonmusk> I spoke directly with The President three weeks ago about Paris. Many others have too. Cautiously optimistic of a positive decision.\n",
      "866797334037807104 2017-05-22 19:26:03 EDT <elonmusk> Interesting idea. Would give a dynamic 360 deg surround view as you're driving. Have this in dev mode. Can be a bit distracting though.\n",
      "866796801994641408 2017-05-22 19:23:56 EDT <elonmusk> Early next year. To start with, we're making the simplest Model 3 first, like we did with S. Didn't do it with X, because I was an idiot.\n",
      "866794741186183171 2017-05-22 19:15:45 EDT <elonmusk> We could add that function pretty easily from a technical standpoint. Just need to add in the billing software.\n",
      "866794454731993089 2017-05-22 19:14:36 EDT <elonmusk> Can be set higher than that for highways, but limited to +5mph or +8km/h off highway (true avg drive speed) for pedestrian & cyclist safety\n",
      "866507691644002304 2017-05-22 00:15:07 EDT <elonmusk> Exactly\n",
      "866482406160609280 2017-05-21 22:34:38 EDT <elonmusk> Still on for end of year. Just software limited. Any Tesla car with HW2 (all cars built since Oct last year) will be able to do this.\n",
      "866481510399881216 2017-05-21 22:31:05 EDT <elonmusk> There's just no way. Hundreds of parts and most of wiring harness would have to be replaced. Would cost more to retrofit than trading in.\n",
      "866481163170349056 2017-05-21 22:29:42 EDT <elonmusk> HW2. HW1 doesn't have enough sensors and computing power.\n",
      "866480832302555136 2017-05-21 22:28:23 EDT <elonmusk> Hopefully June for those too\n",
      "866480356412727298 2017-05-21 22:26:30 EDT <elonmusk> S for sure. It is a bigger car.\n",
      "866473736676950016 2017-05-21 22:00:11 EDT <elonmusk> I'd highly recommend upgrading to latest Model S (which is approx version 4). Only if you really want a smaller sedan, should you get a 3.\n",
      "866473048639066112 2017-05-21 21:57:27 EDT <elonmusk> Maybe I'm misinformed, but I was told that 30% of parts must be locally sourced and the supply doesn't yet exist in India to support that.\n",
      "866472504541368321 2017-05-21 21:55:18 EDT <elonmusk> Yeah, control algorithm is safe, but unpleasant. New one is even safer, but super smooth.\n",
      "866472074142822402 2017-05-21 21:53:35 EDT <elonmusk> Almost there, plus much improved web browser\n",
      "866471925379235842 2017-05-21 21:52:59 EDT <elonmusk> That will be tied to deliveries of the first production cars in July\n",
      "866471370418339840 2017-05-21 21:50:47 EDT <elonmusk> Almost there. Probably in a few months.\n",
      "866470958059536384 2017-05-21 21:49:09 EDT <elonmusk> You can easily turn it off in the car via settings, but that would beg the question of why you turned it off :)\n",
      "866470572967903232 2017-05-21 21:47:37 EDT <elonmusk> Something cool for sure\n",
      "866470387248316416 2017-05-21 21:46:53 EDT <elonmusk> Excited about the Tesla Autopilot software release rolling out next month. New control algorithm feels as smooth as silk.\n",
      "866469349090926592 2017-05-21 21:42:45 EDT <elonmusk> Model 3, Model X & Model S will all have same level of Autopilot capability. It's just a matter of refining the vision & control software.\n",
