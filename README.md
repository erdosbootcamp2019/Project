## Ideas 

Sentiment analysis of tweets, looking for correlation/prediction in stock prices 

Perhaps focus in on tweets from Bloomberg, CNN Business, NBC finance, WSJ ?

Focus on specific company or sector?

## Relevant materials:

* Get stock data from quandl (https://ntguardian.wordpress.com/2018/07/17/stock-data-analysis-python-v2/)

* Scrape twitter using tweepy for occurence of a hashtag of a publicly traded company, for instance Tesla (https://www.promptcloud.com/blog/scrape-twitter-data-using-python-r/)
